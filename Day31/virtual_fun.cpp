// When the same function name with same prototype is used in the both base and derived classes, 
//the function in the base class is declared as Virtual using the keyword virtual preceding its normal declaration
//2.Virtual functions can only be member functions.
//3. Run-time polymorphism is achieved only when a virtual function is accessed by a pointer to the base class.
